\title{Blood data for patients with narrowing arteries}
\description{

Data were collected on the concentration of plasma cholesterol and plasma triglycerides (mg/dl) for 371 male patients evaluated for chest pain. For 51 of those patients, no evidence of heart disease was found. This subset corresponds to the remaining 320 patients for which there was evidence of narrowing arteries.
