\title{Fighter plane dataset}
\description{
The fighter plane dataset of Thakoor and Gao (2005) describes 7 shapes: of the Mirage,
Eurofighter, F-14 with wings closed, F-14 with wings opened, Harrier, F-22 and F-15.
Each class contains 30 shape samples obtained from digital pictures, which Thakoor and
Gao (2005) then reduced to the univariate functions. 
}
\usage{data("plane")}
\format{
A list of arrays corresponding to each plane. For each plane, a three-dimensional \eqn{t} by \eqn{n} by \eqn{p = 1} array is available. The index \eqn{t} corresponds to the different points of measurement, the index \eqn{n} to the different observation. 
}
