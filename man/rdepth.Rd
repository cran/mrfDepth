\title{Regression depth of hyperplanes}
\description{
Computes the regression depth of several hyperplanes with
 respect to a multiple regression dataset with \eqn{p} explanatory variables.
 The calculation is exact for \eqn{p <= 3}.
 An approximate algorithm is used for \eqn{p>3}.
}
\usage{
rdepth(x, z = NULL, ndir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An \eqn{n} by \eqn{p+1} regression dataset. \cr
          The first \eqn{p} columns are the explanatory variables. The last
          column corresponds to the response variable.
  }
  \item{z}{An \eqn{m} by \eqn{p+1} matrix containing rowwise the hyperplanes for which to compute the regression depth. The first column should contain the intercepts. \cr
           If \code{z} is not specified, it is set equal to \code{x}.}
	\item{ndir}{Controls the number of directions when the approximate
              algorithm is used. Defaults to \eqn{250p}.}
}
\details{
Regression depth has been introduced in Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999). To compute the regression depth of a hyperplane, different algorithms are used. When \eqn{p <= 3} it can be computed exactly. In higher dimensions an approximate algorithm is used (Rousseeuw and Struyf 1998). 

It is first checked whether the data \code{x} lie in a subspace of
dimension smaller than \eqn{p + 1}. If so, a warning is given, as well as the  dimension of the subspace and a direction which is orthogonal to it.}
 
\value{
 A  list with components: \cr
  \item{depthZ}{A vector containing the regression depth of the hyperplanes in \code{z}.}
  \item{singularSubsets}{ A vector of length \eqn{m}. \cr
               For each hyperplane, it contains the number of singular subsamples when the approximate algorithm is used. The actual number of directions used in the algorithm therefore equals \code{ndir-singularSubsets}.}
  \item{dimension}{When the data \code{x} are lying in a lower dimensional subspace, the dimension of this subspace.}
  \item{hyperplane}{When the data \code{x} are lying in a lower dimensional subspace, a direction orthogonal to this subspace.}
