\title{Writing trajectories of the letter i.}
\description{
Subset of the 'Character Trajectories Data Set' from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set consists of trajectories of the tip of a pen whilst writing the letter 'i'. All samples are from the same writer. Original data has been processed.

\usage{
data(characterI)
}
\format{
Three dimensional array. The first dimension represents time. The second dimension corresponds to the observation number. The third dimensions contain the X and Y coordinates.
